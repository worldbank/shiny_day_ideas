# Shiny Day ideas
Living document to organize ideas for an upcoming Shiny day at the Bank

## Things to define

### Date:
February 2021 (as part of data day)
  
### Content / type of sessions:
- Focus on general staff/TTLs: showcase existing uses of shiny within the Bank and how projects can use this tool. Possibly a ligthning talks kind of format? 
Good to have the users of the apps presenting as well, and not only the developers.
   - M&E (DIME has a couple of examples, IFC used to have quite a few)
   - Allow clients to interact with data (DIME has a few examples)
   - Sampling (Michael Wild)
   - Share information within teams (DIME has a couple of examples)
- Focus on R users: sequential training sessions of Shiny development (see notes below)

## Random ideas

### Sequential workshops
Sequential series of Shiny development workshop building a client-focused use case based on Bank data
* Beginners: very basic
* Intermediate: adding some functionalities
* Advanced: customize layout
* Shiny in production (How to structure a Shiny app that will hold the test of time - golem framework)

### Sharing apps and use cases
Having a space (Microsoft teams??) for Shiny developers to share their apps in production stage and link to code when openly available

### Session on non-Shiny/R tools

## To discuss with RStudio

What kind of support can they provide? It would be great if they could hold some of the training sessions, but there may be a cost involved in that. Would also be nice to be able to use RStudio Cloud for the trainings.
