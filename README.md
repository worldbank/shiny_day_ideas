# shiny_day_ideas
Living document to organize ideas for an upcoming Shiny day at the Bank

## Things to define
* Scope: Shiny only / Dashboards (R, Python) / Delivering data products to clients??
  A Shiny only focus may be easier to manage and structure. A couple of sessions on other solutions could be added, but the main focus would stay on Shiny
* Content / type of sessions

## Random ideas
To appeal to a broad range of R users, we could have a sequential series of Shiny development workshop:
* Beginners
* Intermediate
* Advanced
* Shiny in production (How to structure a Shiny app that will hold the test of time - golem framework)
